# Shift Recruitment Management System

This is a system for recruiting shifts such as part-time jobs that do not have a fixed time.

## Description

Here, the person in charge of recruiting shifts is called the manager, and the person submitting shifts is called the part-time workers. This system makes it easy for managers to recruit part-time workers for shifts.

## Usage

Managers: You can distribute shift requests at the date and time they want to recruit, and can output collected shifts in a table.
Part-time workers: You can submit your desired date and time for the shift requests sent out.

## Demo

There is a login function that can be used only by people who belong to that company.
